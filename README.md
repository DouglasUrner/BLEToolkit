# BLEToolkit

A toolkit (Swift/iOS for now) to bootstrap building "account free" apps for interacting with BLE devices.

## Motivation

Many Bluetooth enabled devices: scales, multimeters, medical devices, use a smartphone as a display, to log data, or to connect to another (local) service such as Apple Health -- for most of these use cases there is no need for an account
